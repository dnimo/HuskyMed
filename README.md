## About this project

This project is created to practice the auto-summarization from Clinical Notes based on KuoCh'ing's master thesis
project.
The data resources are from Kyoto University Hospital, and the project is supervised by Prof. Tomohiro Kuroda.
We are sort of 10 years of clinical notes from the hospital, and the data is preprocessed by the hospital's staff.

It is related to the following conference presentation:
